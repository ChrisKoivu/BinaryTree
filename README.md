# BinaryTree
Java Implementation of a Binary Tree 

Implements a binary tree and performs recursive scans, inserts, and deletes. Also added functionality using a stack class to aid in iterative traversals of the binary tree. This program also illustrates the problem of deleting a parent node with two children, and on how to reassign the pointers to the child nodes after deletions. This structure is similar to LinkedLists, except the design optimizes searching by directing navigation to the left or the right based on a comparison function implemented on the ascii value of the characters searched.
